      <h2>A Family Tradition</h2>
      <p>
        Cupcakes have been a sweet part of my life since childhood. Baking with my mom created memories that were just as warm and delightful as the cupcakes themselves. Whether it was for a birthday, family event, or her coworkers, we always found a reason to bake.

      <h2>Favorite Flavor: Red Velvet</h2>
      <p>
        Red velvet cupcakes with rich cream cheese frosting were always a favorite in our house. That perfect blend of cocoa, vanilla, and tangy cream cheese still brings back delicious memories.
